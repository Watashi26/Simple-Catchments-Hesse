# Simple Catchments and Where to Find Them
Repository for a paper about the behavior of rivers in Hesse (Germany), which analyzes what causes simple behavior in rivers. 

## Preprocessing
The raw data from the HLNUG and other sources is preprocessed to bring all data in the same format. The data that is used for the analysis is found in the cleaned data folder. This also contains the polygons for all catchments. The code in "create_cleaned_data_table.py" is used to access the data in one convenient dataframe and also translates everything to English. 

## Analysis
The analysis is split into the different figures and calculations. The files are named accordingly.
